## Introduction

I build this project for [Django Celery Tutorial Series](https://www.accordbox.com/blog/django-celery-tutorial-series/)

You can find all the sourc code of the tutorial in this project.

## How to use this project

If you want to know how to run this project on local env, please read [How to setup Celery with Django](https://www.accordbox.com/blog/how-to-setup-celery-django/)

After that, you can add, edit code to learn Celery on your own.

The only thing I want you to bear in mind is that Celery worker does `auto reload` after `code change`, but you can solve this problem [How to auto-reload Celery worker on Code Change](https://www.accordbox.com/blog/how-auto-reload-celery-worker-code-change/)
